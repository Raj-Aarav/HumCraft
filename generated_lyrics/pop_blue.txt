(Verse 1)
The sky was crying tears of blue
A somber melody, the rain sang through
My heart felt heavy, weighed down low
But something whispered, "Let the rhythm flow"

(Chorus)
Dance in the rain, let it wash away the pain
Feel the sun break through, a golden ray
A rainbow arches, a promise in the sky
Hope is dancing, reaching up so high

(Verse 2)
The puddles shimmer, reflecting light
Mirroring the strength I hold inside
The storm is fading, the clouds drift by
A gentle breeze whispers, "Don't you cry"

(Bridge)
From shades of gray to vibrant hues
The world awakens, fresh and new
The air is sweet with possibility
A symphony of hope, just wait and see

(Chorus - Refrain)
Dance in the rain, let it wash away the pain
Feel the sun break through, a golden ray
A rainbow arches, a promise in the sky
Hope is dancing, reaching up so high

(Outro)
Blue skies above, a brand new day
Dance in the sunlight, come what may
Hope is dancing, shining bright and free
Hope is dancing, eternally.
