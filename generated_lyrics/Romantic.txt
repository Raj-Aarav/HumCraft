(Verse 1)
Sunrise paints the eastern sky, a blush of pink and gold
Another day begins without you, a story left untold
The world keeps spinning, life goes on, they say it's meant to be
But every breath I take feels hollow, a constant ache for thee

(Chorus)
Lost in the ocean of your eyes, a beautiful, endless blue
I'm drowning in this longing, love, a love so deep and true
This life feels incomplete without you, like a song with missing notes
My heart beats only for your presence, a love that time promotes

(Verse 2)
I walk the streets we used to roam, each corner holds a trace
Of laughter shared and whispered words, a smile upon your face
The memories flicker like a flame, against the growing dark
And in the silence of the night, I hear love's silent spark

(Bridge)
Across the miles that keep us apart, I reach for you in dreams
A phantom touch, a whispered sigh, it's more than it seems
This burning need, this deep desire, it consumes my every thought
Until the day we're reunited, a future dearly bought

(Chorus - Refrain)
Lost in the ocean of your eyes, a beautiful, endless blue
I'm drowning in this longing, love, a love so deep and true
This life feels incomplete without you, like a song with missing notes
My heart beats only for your presence, a love that time promotes


(Outro)
Oh, to hold you close again, beneath the fading light
And lose myself within your love, and make everything feel right. 
Beautiful, beautiful, my love so true...
I'm longing, always longing, just for you.
