(Verse 1)
Six strings whisper secrets low
A rhythm in my soul starts to flow
Fingers dance on fretworn wood
Lost in the music, understood
A tapestry of sound, soft and slow
Where do these melodies go?

(Chorus)
The drums beat a steady time
Echoing the rhythm of my mind
Thoughts like notes, rise and fall
A symphony within these walls
Guitar cries a melancholic strain
Washing away the lingering pain

(Verse 2)
Sun sets low, casting shadows long
The music plays, a mournful song
Each strum a memory, bittersweet
A moment captured, incomplete
The echo of a laughter's chime
Lost in the corridors of time

(Bridge)
The music swells, a crashing wave
Washing over fears I couldn't brave
In this sonic sanctuary, I find release
A moment's solace, a fragile peace
The world outside fades far away
Lost in the music's gentle sway

(Chorus)
The drums beat a steady time
Echoing the rhythm of my mind
Thoughts like notes, rise and fall
A symphony within these walls
Guitar cries a melancholic strain
Washing away the lingering pain

(Outro)
Fading notes, a whispered sigh
The music ends, but the questions lie
In the silence, I'm left to ponder
The mysteries that linger yonder…
The guitar sleeps, the drums are still
But the music echoes on… it always will.
