(Verse 1)
Sunlight paints your sleeping face
A whisper soft, a gentle grace
So innocent, and unaware
Of all the love I have to share
Watching you breathe, slow and deep
My heart a secret I will keep

(Chorus)
You're a whisper in the morning light
A star that twinkles in the night
So cute, a precious little thing
The joy and hope you always bring
My admiration grows each day
For you, in every single way

(Verse 2)
The way you smile, a sudden gleam
A childhood dream, it would seem
Your tiny hands, so soft and small
I want to catch you if you fall
With tender care, I'll hold you near
And whisper words you long to hear

(Bridge)
The world outside can be so rough
But in your eyes, there's more than enough
Innocence pure, a shining ray
Guiding me through each passing day

(Chorus - Refrain)
You're a whisper in the morning light
A star that twinkles in the night
So cute, a precious little thing
The joy and hope you always bring
My admiration grows each day
For you, in every single way


(Outro)
Shhh, sleep tight, my little one
My love for you has just begun
Shhh, sleep tight, and dream so sweet
My love's a promise, I'll repeat.
