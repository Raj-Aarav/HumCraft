(Verse 1)
Sunlight through the dusty pane, illuminating floating dust motes
Classroom hushed, a world away, filled with whispered hopes and notes
Remember how we'd steal a glance, across the worn-out wooden floor?
My heart would pound, a silent dance, wishing class would end and wanting more

(Chorus)
Those old familiar hallways hold a memory so sweet
The echo of our laughter, a rhythm incomplete
Locked in your gaze, I lost my way, in those deep and soulful eyes
A classroom love, a bygone day, beneath nostalgic skies

(Verse 2)
Chalkboard scribbles, faded dreams, of futures yet unknown
We carved our initials in the beams, a secret love we'd shown
The scent of paper, ink, and time, a fragrance I recall
A simple touch, a love sublime, held captive in this hall

(Bridge)
Years have passed, the seasons turned, life's journey pulled us far
But still, the flame of love has burned, a flickering, distant star
I close my eyes and I am there, back in that classroom old
Feeling your presence in the air, a story yet untold

(Chorus - Refrain)
Those old familiar hallways hold a memory so sweet
The echo of our laughter, a rhythm incomplete
Locked in your gaze, I lost my way, in those deep and soulful eyes
A classroom love, a bygone day, beneath nostalgic skies

(Outro)
Beneath nostalgic skies…
Our classroom love…
In your eyes…
A memory so sweet…
